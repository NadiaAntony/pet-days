#### short story
As a digital nomad traveling with 2 dogs, keeping track of all their medical and vaccine records has been challenging. Especially since one of my dogs has had some recent health issues. I needed a way to keep track of all the vet visits, test results, vaccine certificates, etc. as well as be able to share them with new vets and our home base vet back in Colorado. Thus, an R shiny app was born.

#### refactor steps
- [ ] Setup R/RStudio
```
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/usr/local/bin/R
```
- [ ] runApp()
- [ ] install required libraries, update a requirement.txt file to keep track
- [ ] Run MySQL locally
